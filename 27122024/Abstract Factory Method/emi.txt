The EMI for a home loan is calculated using the formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1] 
P: The principal loan amount
N: The loan tenure in months
R: The monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12 and then by 100
You can use a home loan EMI calculator to estimate your EMI amount. These calculators can also help you understand how different loan terms affect your EMI and total interest expenses. 
Some factors that can affect your EMI include: 
Loan tenure: A longer tenure will result in lower EMIs, and vice versa.
Interest rate: A lower interest rate will result in lower EMIs.
Loan amount: A larger loan amount will result in higher EMIs, and vice versa.
